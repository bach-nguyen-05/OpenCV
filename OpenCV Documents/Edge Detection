1. cv2.Canny(image, threshold1, threshold2)
    
    The parameter threshold1 and threshold2 are the two threshold values used in hysteresis procedure

    Hysteresis:

2. Explanation
    if a pixel gradient is:
        i.    greater than threshold2, the pixel is accepted as an edge
        ii.   below threshold1, the pixel is rejected, and is not an edge
        iii.  lie between threshold1 and threshold2
                + Based on their connectivity, they are classified as edges or non-edges 
                + If they connected to "sure-edges" (> threshold2), they are edges 
                + Otherwise, they will be discarded
3.  Terminology
    + Pixel: the smallest unit of an image. They are accessed by (x, y) coordinate. Origin (0, 0) is located on the top left
            No matter how many values/ pixel, each of which is represented by any integer whose range is from 0 to 255
        i.  GRAYSCALE: Each pixel has 1 value.
        ii. BGR: Each pixel has 3 values.
    + Pixel Gradient Value (in an image): represents in intensity of pixel values in a particular direction
        i.  Gradient Magtitude
        ii. Gradient Direction/ Orientation
